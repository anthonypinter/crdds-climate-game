              <h3>Climate Justice is an explicit acknowledgment that the climate crisis has far-reaching effects that impact 
              people differently based on social and economic factors such as education, income, employment status, environment, and more.</h3>
              
              <h3>The University Libraries and the Center for Research Data & Digital Scholarship (CRDDS) believe that sharing 
              knowledge is a human right, and tackling the climate crisis requires the rapid exchange of knowledge across 
              geographic, economic, and disciplinary boundaries.</h3>
              
              <h3>Consider how you as an academic researcher would balance sharing knowledge and tackling the climate crisis 
              against the current academic landscape.</h3>
